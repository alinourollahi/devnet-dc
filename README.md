# devnet-dc

### about
This project aims to prepare a test environment for Devnet engineers with a docker container.  
In this container, lots of necessary and common packages have already been installed. Also, I install zsh on this container. (using this repo: https://github.com/deluan/zsh-in-docker)

### Usage
Just clone the repo and run this command: 

```
docker-compose up -d
```
